# Auto Defect Insights

## Tech Stack  
- Python (requests, pandas, BeautifulSoup)  
- SQL (PostgreSQL on AWS RDS)  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Excel (for visualization and dashboards)  
- Mermaid, draw.io (for diagrams)  
- Git & GitHub  

## Project Objective  
This project helps automotive manufacturers and suppliers identify which vehicle models and components drive the most recalls and consumer complaints. By connecting real-world defect data from the **NHTSA API** and **CarComplaints.com**, I surface insights to help QA and operations teams prioritize fixes that will reduce risk, warranty costs, and customer dissatisfaction.

## Job Description  
This project was built in alignment with the **Data Analyst Intern** role at **Sanmina Corporation**, a leading electronics manufacturing services (EMS) provider. The role emphasizes data extraction, cleaning, KPI analysis, dashboard development, and support for operational decisions across sectors like automotive and clean tech.

Sanminaâ€™s focus on product quality and cross-functional analytics aligns perfectly with this project, which builds end-to-end pipelines to extract, analyze, and visualize defect trends for automotive programs.

## Data  

**Sources:**  
- [NHTSA Recalls API](https://api.nhtsa.gov/recalls/recallsByVehicle)  
- [CarComplaints.com](https://www.carcomplaints.com/)

**Key Characteristics:**  
- **NHTSA API**: JSON, 2000â€“2025 recall data by make, model, year, component  
- **CarComplaints.com**: HTML-scraped complaint counts by vehicle model

## Notebooks / Python Scripts  

- [`NHTSA_API_SQL_Analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/NHTSA_API_SQL_Analysis.ipynb)  
  Performs descriptive and diagnostic analysis of government recall data using SQL CTEs, window functions, and joins.

- [`CarComplaints_Web_Scrape_SQL_Analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/CarComplaints_Web_Scrape_SQL_Analysis.ipynb)  
  Analyzes consumer complaint volume by model, identifying which cars generate the most dissatisfaction.

- [`export_to_csv.py`](reports/export_to_csv.py)  
  Exports cleaned SQL query results to CSV for visualization in Excel.

## Future Improvements  

- Automate the full pipeline using **dbt** or **Airflow**, with scheduled refreshes and version-controlled SQL models.  
- Integrate **Looker Studio** or **Power BI** for real-time dashboards instead of static Excel charts.
